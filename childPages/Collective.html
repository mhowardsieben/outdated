            <h3>As a member of a family.</h3>
              <article>
                <p>
                  My family is very important part of my life, as it should be an important part of everyone elses life. Family is probably the first collective anyone is introduced too, they give you their language, customs, religion, and general habits. My whole family comes from Europe, my mom is English and French, my dad is German and Italian.  I'm the quiet, yet sociable member of my family. I talk with everyone, but mostly just sit in the corner by myself. My family does the normal North American of Euro descent stuff, Christmas(which is my personal favourite), Easter, Halloween... you know stuff like that. I've always considered my mom a role model considering she raised me and my sibilings single handedly, while also attending university. She always entertained my interests as well, from answering my questions about movie special effects, to encouraging my love of music. My family has been vital to shaping my identity, my mom in particular, and no matter what they do or have done, they will always have a place in my life and I will always love them.

            <h3>As a friend.</h3>
                <article>
                  <p>
                    Now that I've finished with the cheese cake that is the family section, I'll move on to the friend section. While amongst my family I'm the quiet yet sociable one, amongst my friends though I'm the talkative one. I truly enjoy talking myself to exhaustion, in fact, I think I might make a good U.S senator. I have 3 main friends, Thomas, Lucas, and Levi, but I've got many more that aren't as close as them. When around my friends I'm eccentric, talkative and all around social. Relating to a previous aspect 2 of the main 3 are planning on forming a band with me... I'm learning guitar and vocals, while Thomas is learning bass, and Levi is learning drums. I'm real close to my friends, I'm even thinking of renting a house with them when time comes to eventually move out. They honestly form my identity by being there to always support me, cheer me up, and deal with my antics.

                <h3>As an Anglo-Canadian.</h3>
                    <article>
                      <p>
                        I'm a proud Canadian. I consider myself a nationalist, however I have to clarify I'm not a ethocentric nationalist. I guess you could call it patriotism, I don't care what race or of what descent you are, as long as you adhere to Canadian national values <em>Including multiculturalism</em> you're cool in my eyes. Anyways I'm a truly proud member of this country. Having lived in this country my whole life it's culture, ideas and symbols have shaped my identity and the way I view the world. I also conisder myself a staunch Royalist believing in the inherint power of the Crown. I'n also an Anglophone this was of course influenced by my country that is Canada as it's the language 75% of the country speaks and one of the Official Languages

                        On the left is the Canadian flag I chose this because as mentioned I'm a nationalist and proud of my country, on the right is an Oxford Dictionary of English this represents my anglophoness.
