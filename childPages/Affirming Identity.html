                  <article>
                    <p>I affirm my Globalized Identity as an anime fan litterally by watching anime every day, like if I have any downtime in which I'm not doing work, editing, playing games, or listening/playing music I'm watching anime. Now since I have a lot of downtime I'm just usually watching anime anyway.</p>
