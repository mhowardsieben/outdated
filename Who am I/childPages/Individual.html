          <h3>As a musician</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                Well I used to be in instrumental band, I play guitar, I spend all day just listening to or playing music, and I plan on taking singing lessons after the covid-19 vaccine is out... so hopefully around April. Point is music is one of my passions, it's one of the most important parts of being Mikael. My love of music comes from the raw emotion that escapes the mechanations of man kinds making, the rythmic thud the bass provides, the energizing pounding of the drum, the melodic strumming of the guitar, and of course the manipulation of the body to create a beautiful harmonic voice. I mainly listen to punk pop rignt now, but i usually cycle between genres and artist.

          <h3>As a gamer</h3>
              <article>
                <p>
                  I love video games, they're a love that I occasionally need a break from, but I never the less love them. My two favourite games also represent my two favourite genres. In one corner Crusader Kings 2 representing historical strategy, and in the other corner CS;GO representing competitive shooters. Crusader Kings 2 is actually the main game responsible for my love of history, it introduced me to a whole genre of historical games from the company paradox interactive. CS;GO is honestly just plain fun and different from anything from anything on the market. This is due to it's unique style of firing your weapon, instead of having you look down a scope, CS;GO gives each gun a unique spray pattern they must follow to hit their shots. It also set the precedent for competitive shooters to be 5v5. In short I play video games for fun, relaxation, and a challenge.

              <h3>As a video maker</h3>
                  <article>
                    <p>
                      This is something I do for fun and is actually the only other thing than music that I truly want as my career. Let me explain further, I would like to be a entertainer in general, whether through music or video making. I have a youtube account... which I will not link here as it's content and comedy is truly not school friendly. I also plan on starting to stream once I finally put a door on my room, this not only gives me someplace where I can make money through donations, and subscriptions, but where I can gain content and clips for my videos.
