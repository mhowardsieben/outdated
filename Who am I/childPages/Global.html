            <h3>As an adovcate for CANZUK.</h3>
              <article>
                <p>
                  This one is primarly in relation to language and culture, CANZUK is a proposed economic union between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The idea is that it would also extend to travel agreements and maybe even a shared space agency. The main idea for this economic union is based upon the similarities all these countries have such as a shared monarch, similar national values, all of us has English as one of our Official Languages, and the fact that these nations are all former members of the British Empire. One of the other goals of CANZUK that tickles my fancy the most is the idea of forming a third "pillar" of democracy, this would prevent dominance of Canada by the US, the UK by the EU, and the oceanic countries by China. Of course as a staunch Royalist and Nationalist I would be in favor of this union which would keep Canada strong and free from the dominance of other world super powers.

            <h3>As a fan of Anime</h3>
                <article>
                  <p>
                    Now being a Canadian nationalist many people might expect me not to consume foreign media, well they'd be wrong. I have been a big fan of anime since I was abou 9 years old, it started with more action orientated shows, it moved slowly towards slice of life and romance, then towards more thought provoking shows, and now I have reached the stage where I can watch anything and enjoy it. Anime usually goes through seasonal cycles, I personally despise seasonal shows, but there are a couple I'll watch week to week. One of those shows I'll watch week to week is Re:Zero which is an emotional character drama, but here's the cool part, it's primary genre is isekai, which is a genre known for it's action and self indulgent characters with no personality meant for the audience to attach themselves to. Anyways anime has really shaped my identity, it got me interested in the idea of temporarily living in Japan, and has also got me to take a few Japanese classes, which I wish to resume as soon as possible really. Some anime such as Neon Genesis Evangelion have helped me get through tougher times in my life.

                <h3>As an esports fan</h3>
                    <article>
                      <p>
                        This one kind of fits with games, but really is beast all of its own, and as such I have dcecided to give it, its own spot. In case you aren't aware what esports is, allow me to enlighten you. Esports are competitve video game matches that can be played either just over the internet, or in humongous stadiums with a capacity of 100,000 people or more, with millions of people also watching the game live on twitch. There are plenty of ways for someone who really loves their game to get into Esports. Some people become shoutcasters, some become players, some become analysts, and some people even jump straight into being coaches. My personal favourite esport just so happens to be listed in another aspect in on these pages, and my favourite esport is CS;GO. Observing Esports is an awesome way to improve, its also just plain old fun. No seriously some of the strategies and plays these competitors use and pull are insane. My personal favourite team is liquid... but thats cause they're the best team in NA. Esports are a religion to many people, just as football, soccer, hockey, or baseball are to many people as well.
